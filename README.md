Zipfian_project-similarity_between_SF_neighborhoods
===================================================

This repository contains the python code (ipython notebooks) that I used in my personal project at Zipfian Academy.  I developed a model that can recommend altnerative neighborhoods in SF.  

I had two weeks to develop the idea, collect and munge the data, build a model, and arrive at some useful insights into the data.  

For a full account of the project, please see my blog at: http://ansonwhitmer.tumblr.com/post/76570597222/san-francisco-neighborhood-recommender-zipfian
